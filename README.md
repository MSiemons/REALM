# REALM
Open-source Adaptive Optics plugin for MicroManager

## Introduction
REALM stands for Robust and Effective Adaptive optics in Localization Microscopy and can perform aberration correction in Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM). It can however also be used for aberration correction on bead(s) and other small fiducial markers or to flatten the deformable mirror on a bead sample.

REALM provides an user-friendly interface to allow users to perform SMLM or other types of microscopy in tissue or other complex samples. It is designed for users with little background adaptive optics, but provides access to important parameters such that advanced users can tune the aberration correction algorithm.

## Deformable mirror support
Currently REALM supports the deformable mirror MIRAO52E from Imagine Optics. MicroManager uses device adapters to communicate with devices. You can download the device adapter for MIRAO52E from https://github.com/MSiemons/MIRAO_DeviceAdapter. Here a manual is provided on how to install this device adapter.
